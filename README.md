# ANN-Classification-Churn
This project involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn—whether a customer is likely to leave a bank—based on their profile and banking behavior. The model is trained on historical customer data and learns patterns that indicate a higher likelihood of churn.
